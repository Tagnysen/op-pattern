Pattern discovery on time series has gained a lot of attention since the last decade with the rising power of artificial intelligence. The main application area has been for a while health even though nowadays all the industry is also getting on board. Many researchers have considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, noting that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities.

An interesting problem is to find sub-sequences of time series occurring frequently. Such patterns are called "motifs". Autonomously learning the motifs is difficult because their number, location,
length, and shape are all unknown. However, many proposals on how to extract motifs from a timeseries database have been introduced.

The <b>ikats project</b> addresses that issue by using the Random Projection algorithm.
